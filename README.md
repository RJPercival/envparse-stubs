# Type stubs for envparse

This package adds type annotations for the [envparse](https://github.com/rconradharris/envparse) library.

## Known Issues

- The `force` and `preprocessor` parameters have been omitted.
- A `default` value of `None` is not allowed for `list()`, `tuple()` or `dict()`. Instead, use an empty list/tuple/dict
  as the default.
